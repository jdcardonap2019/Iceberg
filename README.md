# The Jupyter Notebook is created to extract information of all hotels in Bogot√° for the page Tripadvisor. 
We have to import the libraries and dependecies first and then run the second cell. It will write in a csv called 'iceberg_test.csv' all the information founded.
Then, the others cells after that will create another file called hotels_fixed.csv in which some numeric columns will be fixed.
