#API that returns a csv file with all the hotels of any city in Colombia supported by Tripadvisor
For the API, the libraries and dependencies of FASTAPI and Union must be installed. To run it, you must use the uvicorn icebergAPI:app --reload command in the terminal.
After that, you can make requests for the API. 
An URL example could be http://127.0.0.1:8000/hotels/san andres. It is important to mention that the cities supported by this API are the ones that you can see in 
https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotels-g294073-Colombia-Hotels.html.
